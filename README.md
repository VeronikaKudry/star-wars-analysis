This project involves cleaning and analyzing survey data from FiveThirtyEight's Star Wars survey, sourced from SurveyMonkey and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey). The primary goals are to demonstrate essential data cleaning techniques for complex survey responses and to explore insights into Star Wars fandom, including viewer preferences and character popularity.
