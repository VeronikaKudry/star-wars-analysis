# Data Cleaning and Analysis for Surveys - Star Wars Survey

This project involves cleaning and analyzing survey data from FiveThirtyEight's Star Wars survey, sourced from SurveyMonkey and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey). The primary goals are to demonstrate essential data cleaning techniques for complex survey responses and to explore insights into Star Wars fandom, including viewer preferences and character popularity. 

Do you want to know what film is considered **the best**? Or if there is any **trend between education level and familiarity with the "Star Wars" franchise**? or maybe who is **the most unfavorable character of the entire galaxy**? Dive in!

You can find the code and visuals in the Star Wars Survey.ipynb notebook above. The required libraries are listed in requirements.txt. The source data is available in data folder.
